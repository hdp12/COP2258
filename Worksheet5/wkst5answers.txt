Question 1: What does this error mean? Why do we have this error?
	The error means that we tried to implement the ActionListener and KeyListener 
	without including the abstract methods that they include. The error is 
	present because they are not present in the class. 
	
Question 2: Where did the methods c.setSize() and c.setVisible() come from?
	They were imported with JFrame which inherited them from Frame which inherited 
	them from Window.

Question 3: Using the API, why can we use the add method from the Container class 
in the ChatClient class?
	Because JFrame extends Frame which extends Window which extends Container. 
	So by importing JFrame, the ChatClient class is able to use the add method 
	from the Container class.
	
Question 4: Why can we use the 'this' keyword to add an ActionListener and a 
KeyListener?
	Because it is a keyword that refers to that instantiation of the class. 
	It can be used twice because it is basically referring to itself, or 
	more vaguely, the instance in which it is used.
	
Question 5: What does this method do?
	It pays attention to the keys that the user is pressing, with special focus 
	on the enter key, and if the enter key is pressed, (with the key code constant
	VK_...) it appends the typed text to the end of the document, aka puts it in 
	the sent chat box.
	
Question 6: What does this method do?
	It basically does the same thing that the previous method does but it pays 
	attention to if the 'send' button is pressed. And if that button is pressed
	it appends the typed text to the end of the document, aka puts it in 
	the sent chat box.
